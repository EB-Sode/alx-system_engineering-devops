working through a series of Linux shell scripting exercises, focusing on environment variables, command substitution, arithmetic operations, and base conversions. 
I started by creating simple scripts — defining aliases, printing the current Linux user, modifying the PATH, and counting directories in it. 
I then advanced to scripts that list environment and local variables, create new variables, and perform arithmetic with environment variable values. 
I explored mathematical expressions using $(( )), expr, and bc, applying them to division, exponentiation, and base conversions between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal. 
Later, I implemented scripts for string manipulation and stream processing — such as encoding text with ROT13, printing alternate lines from input, 
and generating all combinations of two letters except “oo.”
